# MikroTiChestra
There is a beeper in some MikroTik routersâ€¦ You know what I mean.

## Demo

## Usage

1. Grab a bunch of MikroTik routers [with a beeper](https://mikrotik.com/products/group/ethernet-routers?filter&s=c&f=%5B%22beeper%22%5D).

   Ideally, you want to mix-and-match different models, as different chassis resonate differently, providing tonal variance between channels.

2. Build the project using
```
$ go get -u -v
$ go build
```

3. Copy the example configuration file
```
$ cp MikroTiChestra.conf{.example,}
```

4. Edit the configuration file.

5. Create some MIDI files using your favorite DAW software.

6. Grab a wired connection to one or more MikroTik routers since Wi-Fi is unreliable.

7. SSH into your routers at least once to ensure `~/.ssh/known_hosts` contains public keys of your routers, this is for security.

8. Party on!
```
$ ./MikroTiChestra super_mario_bros_overworld.mid never_gonna_give_you_up.mid
```
